# Quickstart

Follow this guide to get up and running with Reticle Server in minutes.

## MongoDB

Install the [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

There's no need to create a database, one will be made by the server.

You might also want **MongoDB Compass Community** which is a client for viewing the database. 

## Reticle Server

Once the database is online, compile and start the server!

### Server With Client (Development)

If you want a single command to bring the client & server up, refer to the client's `package.json`

### Server Only (Production)

To run Reticle Server in standalone mode, just run 
```
npm run start
```
